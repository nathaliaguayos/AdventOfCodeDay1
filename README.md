# Day 1: Chronal Calibration

This project is named "Chronal_Calibration" and is based on the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge of day 1, you should now that is a C# solution created in Visual Studio. The Solution has 2 projects actually, one is the "Chronal_Calibration" which is the main project, is where I created the code to solve the challenge and the other one is "Chronal_Calibration_Tests" which is where the Unit Tests were created. 



## Getting Started

First of all, thank you for coming to take a look into my repository, it is a little empty now, but I'll work on keeping it growing. At this moment you should know what kind of project is it, but please continue reading I'll let you know what are the prerequisites to get a copy of my project on your local machine and how you can run it.


### Prerequisites

About software

```
Install Visual Studio 2017
Install Git
```
Once you have installed the previous software, please clone my repo to your local machine. 

### Running the project

Now I'm going to tell you how you can run the application and explain a little the response that you'll receive.  

1. Open the "Chronal_Calibration" project. 
2. Select "Program" Class.
3. Notice that the main class is there, in this method, I'm configuring the information that I need to use for the "FrequencyCalibration" method. 
4. Click on the "Run" button and you will get a result

**NOTE:** *The result would be different every time that you run the application because I used an array with random values to emulate the frequency changes.* 


## Running the tests

To run the test is similar to run the application, with a difference that we need to open our "Test Explorer" view, please make sure that you have it opened and then follow the next instructions:

1. Open the "Chronal_Calibration_Tests" project.
2. Select the "ChronalCalibrationTests" Class. Notice that in this class we have some test methods, and each of them have "Arrange, Act and Assert" sections. 
3. In the Test Explorer, we can do a right-click over the "Chronal_Calibration_Tests" and select "Run the selected Tests".
4. Wait until the Unit Tests run to see the Test results.

**NOTE:** *I used the scenarios given in [Day 1 Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1)* to create the unit tests, but those are not the only scenarios, they could be more.
